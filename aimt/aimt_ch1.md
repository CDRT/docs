# 1 Introduction

This document specifies how user (for example, an IT administrator) uses AMD wireless AIM-T and wired DASH to manage AIM-T system remotely in an enterprise network. AIM-T is a solution that enables AMD-based commercial platforms to provide secure and remote 
management capability. It is achieved by integrating a dedicated core in AMDâ€™s Client SoC 
(starting from AMD RyzenTM 7 PRO processors) along with all the supporting SoC/platform level 
hardware, firmware, software, and interfaces. With the help of special WLAN and LAN modules, 
AIM-T can management a remote system through a Wi-Fi or ethernet connection.
