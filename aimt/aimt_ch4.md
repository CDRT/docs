# 4 Troubleshooting

## 4.1 On AIM-T DASH System 

### 4.1.1 AMS Status is Off

If the **Manageability status** is OFF in the AMS UI tray, user can check the following to recover it: 

+ AIM-T is ON in the BIOS menu 
+ Device Manager > System > AMS-MailboxDrv works properly 
+ Launch services to ensure that AMS is running 

### 4.1.2 Red AMS UI Tray 

In some cases, the AMS tray icon will turn red as AMS may not start: 

<div style="text-align:center;">

You can re-launch AMS to recover it. 

Also, you can search for **Services** and start AMD as follows:

### 4.1.3 AMS UI Tray Hangs 

There is a known issue that the AMS UI tray will hang after resuming from hibernate. However, it does not impact any AIM-T functionality because AMS UI and its service are separate and the service runs properly when UI hangs. When the AMS UI tray hangs, user can right-click the AMS icon to exit and re-launch it from the Windows Start Menu. 

The AMS UI tray will be in green when it is working properly:

## 4.2 On Console (DASH CLI) System 

### 4.2.1 KVM Command Response 

Both OS KVM and BIOS KVM require a KVMSSHKey which is in a provisioning package generated by the user (refer to Appendix A) and should be saved in: 
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\DASH CLI 4.x\certs\
```        

The folder *certs* is set as an administrator folder which may be controlled by an enterprise IT policy.

### 4.2.2 Unresponsive AIM-T System 

<div style="text-align:center;">

Figure 4-6. Unresponsive AIM-T System</div>

When a AIM-T system is in the shutdown mode, the console cannot get any DASH response immediately. You should wake the AIM-T system up by sending a DASH command. Then, the AIM-T system will take one to one and a half minute to be ready for handling DASH commands. 

You can keep sending DASH commands to ensure that the AIM-T system is ready. 

<div style="text-align:center;">

Other reasons for a AIM-T system being unresponsive can be the AIM-T system is not connected to the same network domain or it is not configured properly. To fix the AIM-T system, refer to section 4.1. 

### 4.2.3 Display is Distorted While Connecting KVM 

<div style="text-align:center;">

When a host system initiates a KVM session with a AIM-T system, the host user (enterprise IT admin) may witness a distorted VNC viewer. Most of the time, this problem happens when the client was in the shutdown mode and woken up by a KVM request. This problem can be recovered by rebooting the AIM-T system. When a host user witnesses the issue, he/she can launch a new DASHCLI console (do not close the old one) and send a power cycle DASH command to the client: 

```
dashcli.exe -h <ipaddress> -u <username> -P <password> -S https -C -p 664
 -t computersystem[0] power cycle
```

This command can reboot the AIM-T system. Then, the host user will see the clientâ€™s BIOS menu with a clear display on the VNC viewer in a few minutes.
