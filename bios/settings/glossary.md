| Admin   (hard disk) password         | it is one of the passwords for hard disk, if selected “Dual Password”   option. For ThinkPads it is Admin + User password, for ThinkCentres and   Thinkstations Master+ User passwords. So, basically Admin (hard disk)   password and Master (hard disk) password are synonyms.
