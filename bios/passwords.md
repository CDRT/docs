# Passwords #

## Power-On Password (POP) ##

## Hard Disk Password (HDP) ##

Controls access to a hard disk.

Users are prompted to type a correct password each time you try to access the storage drive.

The system can create dual passwords for an Admin and another User.

## Supervisor Password (SVP) ##

The Supervisor Password (SVP) protects the system information stored in UEFI BIOS. When entering the UEFI BIOS menu, enter the correct supervisor password in the window prompted. You also can press Enter to skip the password prompt. However, you cannot change most of the system configuration options in UEFI BIOS.

**The supervisor password can be set only through the UEFI BIOS menu.** Once it is in place, then it can be modified using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) with the Lenovo client-management interface.

If you have set both the supervisor password and power-on password, you can use the supervisor password to access your computer when you turn it on. The supervisor password overrides the power-on password.
