## BIOS Reference   <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This section will provide information on deploying updates for BIOS (aka UEFI) on ThinkPad, ThinkCentre and ThinkStation products.  

It will also offer a Settings Dictionary where details on individual BIOS settings can be explained.  Not all models will support all settings.  It is recommended to use a sample system to review the available settings and refer to these pages if there are any questions on the individual settings.
